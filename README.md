# hanvi project
> AI( Artificial Intelligent ) Speaker. 

Listen to my voice and reinvent it with a new voice. In the future, Natural Language Processing(NLP) should be possible.

## Prerequisite
### Authentication
```bash
$ gcloud auth application-default login
```

### Error
If the following error is found when running, the API key is missing. 
Download the API key as a json file as described [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started#auth-cloud-implicit-nodejs). 
You must also specify the path to the file as an environment variable.
```bash

### Install Dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```

## Simple Architecture
<img src="/arch/architecture.png" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;">

## Usage
```bash
$ node hanvi.js
Listening, press Ctrl+C to stop.
Transcription: 좋은 아침입니다
Audio content written to file: output.mp3
Transcription:  음성인식을 테스트 중입니다
Audio content written to file: output.mp3
Transcription:  생각보다 잘 됩니다
Audio content written to file: output.mp3
```
Currently, the recognized voice is _ping/pong_ and saved as `output.mp3` file. 
In future, it will be added the function to output directly through the speaker.
Check the audio samples in the [sampleAudio](./sampleAudio/) directory.
You can also check it on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/9-4r1coNIos).

## TODO
  - [ ] Fixed to respond only when calling `hanvi`
  - [ ] Analyzes the voice and returns the desired answer in `TTS( text to speech )`.
  - [ ] TTS and STT development. ( Without using the Google API )
